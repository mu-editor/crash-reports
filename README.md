# Mu Editor Crash Reports

The Mu Editor has a feature that helps users create a GitHub issue when Mu crashes.

Originally the Mu Crash Reports ended up in the main Mu repository issue tracker: https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues

This creates a lot of noise with similar reports continously being logged for the same problem, which makes it difficult for the developers and users to navigate and organise individual issues, so this repository has been created to contain all the Crash Reports from this point forward: https://github.com/mu-editor/crash-reports/issues

The Mu team will continue to monitor all of these reports, and open issues in the Mu main repository as we identified the problems triggering the crashes.

We want our community to be a friendly place. Therefore, we expect contributors and collaborators to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_of_conduct.html).

Thanks for taking the time to submit your reports, this information vital to find and fix these issues, and we really appreciate them!
